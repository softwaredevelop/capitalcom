    "# API Client Workflow Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a complete, secure workflow for interacting with the Capital.com API using the `get_client` context manager. All API operations are performed within a single `with` block to ensure that the session is created securely and closed automatically, even if errors occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The workflow consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Environment Setup:** We import the necessary libraries and configure the environment to access our project's source code.\n",
    "2.  **Secure Client Initialization:** The `with get_client(...)` statement handles the entire lifecycle of the API client:\n",
    "    - It loads credentials securely from the `.env` file.\n",
    "    - It establishes a new, authenticated session with the API.\n",
    "    - It provides a ready-to-use `client` object for the duration of the block.\n",
    "    - It automatically and safely closes the session when the block is exited.\n",
    "3.  **Session Verification:** Inside the block, we first call `client.ping()` to confirm that the connection is active and valid.\n",
    "4.  **Market Discovery:** We then fetch the top-level market categories to get an overview of the available markets.\n",
    "5.  **Detailed Instrument Data:** Finally, we retrieve all detailed information for a specific instrument (`US500`) to demonstrate a targeted data query."
